## Can you see an S3?

The third heart sound (S3) is thought to be from abrupt deceleration of the left ventricular inflow during early diastole, in the context of increased LV filling pressures and decreased LV compliance. This abrupt change in acceleration is thought to cause vibration in the cardiac chamber, including the chordae and the papillary muscles.

Many studies show that S3 occurs at the peak of early diastolic filling, during the deceleration phase of early mitral inflow (the E wave). S3 is associated with increased early mitral inflow (higher E waves), decrease in the early mitral inflow deceleration time, and a more rapid deceleration all associate with presence/intensity of the S3 heart sound. 

A normal E and A wave represent the two parts of mitral valve inflow. In severe volume overloaded states, seen with diastolic dysfunction, the E wave has a different morphology.

Another study looked at a better way to classify the S3. They used tissue doppler to look at the ventricle response to passive filling. The tissue wave doppler is aimed at the wall next the mitral valve, and measures how much movement occurs at that site. That's listed as the E' wave. The corresponding fluid velocity measurement is the E wave as drawn.

The E/E’ measurement is an even stronger marker and describes not only LV filling pressures but LV stiffness in early diastole.{% cite Shah2008 %} The idea of E/E’ ratio means that there is rapid/abrupt mitral inflow creating a large E wave, with corresponding small E’ wave, meaning poor diastolic relaxation/movement, and that ratio is highly indicative of an S3.
