# Introduction

## Background

Ultrasonography is one of many tools that can be used to assess volume-status, which is a surrogate for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. Visualizing the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an objective finding, requiring clinical context and experience to incorporate into an assessment.

## Objectives

- Appropriately visualize the IVC
- Collapsibility of the vessel
- Current state-of-affairs

# Visualization

The ideal location of measuring the IVC is ~2 cm distal to the right atrium, in a longitudinal/sagittal cut through the subxiphoid position.{% cite Finnerty2017 %} It will be affected by overall volume status, position, effects of the right atrium, and the physical movement of the heart and lungs through their duty cycles.

We are looking at a cross section just under the diaphragm, as the caval system returns to the right atrium. As fluid is **black** on ultrasound, the major vessels and structures are crucial in helping to identify the IVC. You can see the hepatic veins dissected out entering the IVC, just by the dome of liver that will abutt the diaphram.
